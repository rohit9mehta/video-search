            "[03:55.520 --> 03:58.080]  but that's only if you want a little extra pop\n",

            "[05:07.440 --> 05:09.040]  That just looks like pure fluff.\n",
            "[05:09.040 --> 05:10.640]  Put a bit of syrup, a little bit of butter.\n",
            "[05:10.640 --> 05:11.920]  The flavor's unmatched.\n",

            "[05:21.440 --> 05:23.680]  But we can't have this be a win without a taste tester.\n",
            "[05:23.680 --> 05:24.480]  They're gonna start back.\n",
            "[05:24.480 --> 05:25.440]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[05:25.440 --> 05:26.480]  Poop and fart.\n",

            "[05:37.680 --> 05:40.880]  These are fluffy, super layered, butter, syrup, fluff.\n",
            "[05:40.880 --> 05:41.920]  There's nothing not to like.\n",
            "[05:41.920 --> 05:43.200]  All right, on to the next.\n",
            "[05:43.200 --> 05:45.760]  Okay, sure, you could say we won by beating their basic pancake,\n",
            "[05:45.760 --> 05:47.520]  but it doesn't end there, okay?\n",
            "[05:47.520 --> 05:51.520]  There is no win without discussing the toppings that make it really special.\n",
            "[05:51.520 --> 05:52.400]  So, blueberry.\n",
            "[05:52.400 --> 05:54.640]  We're keeping the batter the exact same as they said before.\n",
            "[05:54.640 --> 05:56.640]  The only difference is when you make your batter for this one,\n",
            "[05:56.640 --> 06:00.240]  you could just fold in and have a cup of 95 grams of more fresh blueberries.\n",
            "[06:00.240 --> 06:00.560]  That's it.\n",
            "[06:00.560 --> 06:01.760]  Then you just scoop your batter.\n",
            "[06:01.760 --> 06:05.200]  Do your thing 21 and your pancakes will be fully done once you've cooked all your batter.\n",
            "[06:05.200 --> 06:06.800]  But what about the blueberry sauce?\n",
            "[06:06.800 --> 06:08.960]  I'll be honest, it was a challenge figuring this out for some reason.\n",
            "[06:09.120 --> 06:11.440]  I couldn't figure out if the blueberries were dried or fresh.\n",
            "[06:11.440 --> 06:13.360]  Could tell if they were at the beginning or not,\n",
            "[06:13.360 --> 06:16.240]  because well, they wouldn't be so perfectly round.\n",
            "[06:16.240 --> 06:17.040]  So here's what I did.\n",
            "[06:17.040 --> 06:17.920]  Medium saucepot.\n",
            "[06:17.920 --> 06:20.320]  Add two cups of 190 grams of fresh blueberries,\n",
            "[06:20.320 --> 06:22.560]  one cup or 200 grams of granulated white sugar,\n",
            "[06:22.560 --> 06:24.960]  three tablespoons or 55 grams of lemon juice,\n",
            "[06:24.960 --> 06:26.960]  a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of maple syrup,\n",
            "[06:26.960 --> 06:29.040]  half a cup or 120 milliliters of water,\n",
            "[06:29.040 --> 06:32.320]  and finally one tablespoon or 17 grams of light corn syrup.\n",
            "[06:32.320 --> 06:35.600]  You know, so we give that nice cohesive mirror-like gloss.\n",
            "[06:35.600 --> 06:38.560]  It's a little back pocket secret right there, by the way, with the corn syrup.\n",
            "[06:38.640 --> 06:40.240]  Set that over medium high, bring to a boil,\n",
            "[06:40.240 --> 06:41.760]  and reduce for about six to eight minutes,\n",
            "[06:41.760 --> 06:44.000]  or until extra thickened and syrupy.\n",
            "[06:44.000 --> 06:45.760]  You really wanted to coat the back of a spoon\n",
            "[06:45.760 --> 06:47.840]  the more it clings the thicker it looks, the better.\n",
            "[06:47.840 --> 06:50.800]  Now, pass that through a fine mesh strainer to get an extra glossy,\n",
            "[06:50.800 --> 06:54.400]  and fold in an extra half cup or 95 grams of fresh blueberries.\n",
            "[06:54.400 --> 06:56.560]  And what I gotta say, it looks like the bang thing.\n",
            "[06:56.560 --> 06:58.960]  It looks correct, hopefully it tastes correct.\n",
            "[06:58.960 --> 07:01.200]  Now, you serve these pancakes as before you stack them up,\n",
            "[07:01.200 --> 07:04.320]  give them a generous, beautiful topping of your blueberry sauce.\n",
            "[07:04.320 --> 07:06.800]  So deeply dark blue with a mirror finish,\n",
            "[07:06.800 --> 07:09.600]  almost as beautiful as the metallic specialty paint of a lambered\n",
            "[07:09.600 --> 07:12.400]  cleanie in only the finest of boutique lighting.\n",
            "[07:12.400 --> 07:14.160]  Of course, feel free to add a quanelle,\n",
            "[07:14.160 --> 07:16.560]  or dollop of whipped cream, if you so desire,\n",
            "[07:16.560 --> 07:20.080]  which is made by simply adding one cup or 240 milliliters of heavy cream,\n",
            "[07:20.080 --> 07:21.120]  two medium sized bowl,\n",
            "[07:21.120 --> 07:22.960]  with that aggressively until it begins to thicken,\n",
            "[07:22.960 --> 07:25.280]  then add two tablespoons or 14 grams of powdered sugar,\n",
            "[07:25.280 --> 07:27.760]  continue whisking until you get a nice soft peak,\n",
            "[07:27.760 --> 07:31.440]  and optionally you can fold in one full tablespoon or 15 grams of creme of fresh.\n",
            "[07:31.440 --> 07:32.800]  That's a fun whipped cream right there.\n",
            "[07:32.800 --> 07:34.480]  Now we fight our next opponent.\n",
            "[07:34.480 --> 07:35.280]  All right!\n",
            "[07:35.360 --> 07:37.280]  Little whipped cream, little bit of a berry.\n",
            "[07:37.920 --> 07:39.760]  Oh, so fresh.\n",
            "[07:39.760 --> 07:41.760]  One thing you won't get from theirs is this.\n",
            "[07:43.280 --> 07:46.960]  That was the pop of a plum juicy blueberry.\n",
            "[07:46.960 --> 07:49.040]  To me that's a win, but now we need our taste tester.\n",
            "[07:49.040 --> 07:51.840]  Yeah, okay, so the bigger you don't really like blueberries.\n",
            "[07:51.840 --> 07:52.400]  I did not.\n",
            "[07:52.400 --> 07:54.480]  Yeah, this seems like a bit unfair, but okay.\n",
            "[07:54.480 --> 07:57.040]  Number one, and then...\n",
            "[07:57.040 --> 07:58.000]  Remember that!\n",
            "[07:58.000 --> 07:59.840]  Number two, best person for this one.\n",
            "[07:59.840 --> 08:02.000]  First of all, the first one was better by a landslide.\n",
            "[08:02.000 --> 08:04.640]  It literally punched me in the face with flavor.\n",
            "[08:04.640 --> 08:06.400]  It's fruity as to be expected,\n",
            "[08:06.400 --> 08:09.520]  but I really like the cream mixed with the berries,\n",
            "[08:09.520 --> 08:11.200]  mixed with the fluffiness of a pancake.\n",
            "[08:11.200 --> 08:12.560]  This one just felt flat.\n",
            "[08:12.560 --> 08:14.480]  I need more of this, and I don't even like blueberries.\n",
            "[08:14.480 --> 08:15.200]  That's how good it was.\n",
            "[08:15.200 --> 08:16.720]  Last one is big for this favorite.\n",
            "[08:16.720 --> 08:17.360]  Bring it on.\n",
            "[08:17.360 --> 08:18.640]  Okay, so we got two out of three,\n",
            "[08:18.640 --> 08:21.360]  but this wouldn't be a but better without a three for three.\n",
            "[08:21.360 --> 08:25.360]  Now last but far from least is the only pancake that I actually liked.\n",
            "[08:25.360 --> 08:26.800]  So I'm slightly nervous.\n",
            "[08:26.800 --> 08:30.000]  One of the most popular and inappropriately-named pancake\n",
            "[08:30.000 --> 08:32.160]  in the restaurant world, Sinistac.\n",
            "[08:32.160 --> 08:33.760]  This one should be easy, right?\n",
            "[08:33.760 --> 08:36.080]  First up, the sauce that I passed out five times making,\n",
            "[08:36.080 --> 08:38.320]  if you don't get the job, just move along, please.\n",
            "[08:38.320 --> 08:41.440]  Anyway, adding four ounces or 115 grams of softened cream cheese,\n",
            "[08:41.440 --> 08:42.480]  two medium sized bowl,\n",
            "[08:42.480 --> 08:44.080]  beat with an electric mixer, tilt creamy,\n",
            "[08:44.080 --> 08:46.160]  and then add three quarters of a cup or 90 grams,\n",
            "[08:46.160 --> 08:47.680]  a powdered sugar and two batches,\n",
            "[08:47.680 --> 08:49.920]  being them and fully before adding the remainder.\n",
            "[08:49.920 --> 08:51.280]  Trust me, all right, you don't want a big mess\n",
            "[08:51.280 --> 08:52.400]  in your kitchen, then you get a big job,\n",
            "[08:52.400 --> 08:53.600]  but I happen, then I'm gonna be like,\n",
            "[08:53.600 --> 08:55.440]  ah, I'm really sorry, I should have told you,\n",
            "[08:55.440 --> 08:56.400]  and so I'm telling you now.\n",
            "[08:56.400 --> 08:57.280]  It's because I love you.\n",
            "[08:57.280 --> 08:58.640]  Once that's smooth and combined,\n",
            "[08:58.640 --> 09:01.360]  beat in two tablespoons or 35 grams of whole milk.\n",
            "[09:01.360 --> 09:02.880]  You can always add a little more if you need to.\n",
            "[09:02.880 --> 09:05.120]  You just want it to be a drizzleable consistency\n",
            "[09:05.120 --> 09:07.120]  without it being water, you know, kind of like this.\n",
            "[09:07.120 --> 09:09.200]  Finally, beat in the beans from one piano black beans,\n",
            "[09:09.200 --> 09:10.800]  getting from one vanilla bean pod,\n",
            "[09:10.800 --> 09:12.720]  once it's thoroughly distributed, it's done.\n",
            "[09:12.720 --> 09:15.440]  Now moving on to the most important and slightly mysterious\n",
            "[09:15.440 --> 09:17.600]  cinnamon spread, which who knows how there's this made,\n",
            "[09:17.600 --> 09:19.520]  but let's be honest, we're gonna figure it out.\n",
            "[09:19.520 --> 09:22.880]  In a pan, add one cup or 225 grams of light brown sugar,\n",
            "[09:22.880 --> 09:25.280]  one tablespoon or 14 grams of muscovado sugar,\n",
            "[09:25.280 --> 09:27.280]  half a cup or 120 milliliters of water,\n",
            "[09:27.280 --> 09:30.160]  then set that to medium, once the sugar is completely dissolved,\n",
            "[09:30.160 --> 09:32.720]  add in half a cup or 120 milliliters of maple syrup,\n",
            "[09:32.720 --> 09:34.960]  and at this point, you're gonna bring it to a boil over medium high\n",
            "[09:34.960 --> 09:37.680]  until it reaches 230 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
            "[09:37.680 --> 09:40.000]  Now once it reaches the temperature, turn off the heat,\n",
            "[09:40.000 --> 09:43.200]  then whisk in two and a half tablespoons or 17 grams of ground cinnamon.\n",
            "[09:43.200 --> 09:45.040]  Yes, it's gonna resist wanting to get mixed and you're like,\n",
            "[09:45.040 --> 09:47.840]  oh my god, jesus, that makes it just look trust me, just keep mixing.\n",
            "[09:47.840 --> 09:49.600]  And once that is for the most part combined,\n",
            "[09:49.600 --> 09:53.200]  you will then whisk in a third cup or 84 grams of cold unsalted butter\n",
            "[09:53.200 --> 09:55.920]  until homogenized until fully melted in a emulsified,\n",
            "[09:55.920 --> 09:59.120]  then finally add in one teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt.\n",
            "[09:59.120 --> 10:01.200]  Yes, it's gonna be a little bit salty, sweet, you know,\n",
            "[10:01.200 --> 10:02.640]  think cinnamon roll vibes, right?\n",
            "[10:02.640 --> 10:05.360]  Once it's all combined, you're gonna let that cool until you get a nice,\n",
            "[10:05.360 --> 10:08.560]  almost jimmy salty cinnamon butter spread.\n",
            "[10:08.560 --> 10:10.480]  Now we assemble, which I did like this.\n",
            "[10:10.480 --> 10:14.800]  One pink kick down, spread on your warmed up sauce, next pancake, more sauce, spread,\n",
            "[10:14.800 --> 10:18.160]  your third pancake, you guessed it, spread, and four, well, wait a minute,\n",
            "[10:18.160 --> 10:21.600]  this time, yeah, kidding, more cinnamon spread, okay?\n",
            "[10:21.600 --> 10:23.760]  This stuff is insane. How good it is.\n",
            "[10:23.760 --> 10:25.840]  You will not regret putting it on that thing.\n",
            "[10:25.840 --> 10:28.000]  Let me tell you what, all right, you put that on anything.\n",
            "[10:28.000 --> 10:31.120]  All right, I just don't need to know everything you're putting it on.\n",
            "[10:31.120 --> 10:34.560]  Finally, drizzle the top generously with your vanilla frosting in a spiral shape,\n",
            "[10:34.560 --> 10:37.680]  if you want to avoid it looking like something that people are gonna make jokes about on the\n",
            "[10:37.680 --> 10:39.760]  internet and say things that are inappropriate, okay?\n",
            "[10:39.760 --> 10:44.320]  But now we face our toughest opponent, yeah, this is the ultimate deciding winner if we fully\n",
            "[10:44.320 --> 10:45.920]  beat I have or not.\n",
            "[10:45.920 --> 10:48.080]  Sinistack, this one I liked.\n",
            "[10:49.680 --> 10:51.040]  We saved the best for last.\n",
            "[10:51.040 --> 10:55.520]  I would be able to eat both of these, but in terms of clean, cut flavor,\n",
            "[10:55.520 --> 10:57.760]  this is really like eating straight up a cinnamon roll.\n",
            "[10:57.760 --> 11:00.240]  If we won the other two, there's no way we're not winning this.\n",
            "[11:00.240 --> 11:01.440]  Stick room, get in here.\n",
            "[11:01.440 --> 11:02.960]  Number one, here you go.\n",
            "[11:02.960 --> 11:03.360]  Good.\n",
            "[11:04.240 --> 11:04.560]  Two.\n",
            "[11:07.440 --> 11:08.240]  That's incredible.\n",
            "[11:08.240 --> 11:09.280]  That's definitely the winner.\n",
            "[11:09.280 --> 11:10.160]  Here's the difference.\n",
            "[11:10.160 --> 11:11.920]  This one, you kind of know what to expect.\n",
            "[11:11.920 --> 11:13.840]  This one is literally a cinnamon roll.\n",
